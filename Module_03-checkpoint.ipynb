But I must say that after a long time have I had the opportunity to read such an absorbing murder mystery. Simply thrilling!Senior Inspector Saralkar is called upon a case where a couple are found dead inside their Pune flat. The husband  hanging down a rope and the wife  lying across a bed with her face brutally disfigured. A suicide note is found that clearly states that the husband killed his wife and then committed suicide as a result of an involvement of the wife in an affair. Although it seems straight forward at first  there are pieces that don t fit together for Saralkar. He  along with his team  get down to solving this perplexed situation at hand  only to find things getting worse as they progress.3 and a Half Murders is by Salil Desai  who has previously authored other mysteries as well. I loved the book! From the start  I was spellbound with the narration. A classic who-dun-it  the story moves in a neck breaking speed  indulging the readers with subtle clues and new snippets of information. The story line is intelligent with punches of emotions and humor from time to time. Straight-to-the point narrative  a clear plot and relatable characters is what makes the book extremely fascinting.The story is based in Pune (happy dance!) and the character of Inspector Saralkar is so aptly portrayed. In fact  it checks all the right boxes for a murder mystery. Uh  did I mention it is one of the most absorbing murder mysteries I have read in a long time?These are the kind of books that make me want to keep going back and drink more of the mystery juice! I am definitely going to look out for other books by the author and review them here  so watch this space for more.I totally recommend 3 and a Half Murders if you are a murder mystery fan  I guarantee you ll love it!',\n",

If you love to watch movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger or James Bond film series  you know how sarcasm and punchlines make the tricky situations also light weight.Here are some good pieces of writing from the book itself:Outside  in the drawing room  the man s body swung lifelessly from a noose of nylon rope  fastened to a ceiling hook. He obviously wasn t watching the programme playing on the sports channel  but the television is on.---Happiness is a journey. Begin that journey today. No advance reservation is required for this journey. Just board the train. Don t put it off  don t delay  don t cancel your ticket!---Ã¢â‚¬Â¦only dishonest cops keep lockers. The honest ones are only familiar with lock-ups.---The book is good in terms of pace and even the characters are build nicely. Twists are coming at regular intervals in the book.

On opening the product  I found it exactly as per the expectations. The heater was nicely packed and delivered on schedule. There were no issues with the packing / wiring of insulation or internal parts  as claimed by some buyers. Those may be isolated cases. The product has many push buttons customised for indian items  like pressure cooker  milk boiling  keeping food warm  deep frying etc. The heater has adjustable temperature/ power for customised heating. The product is light weight and has reasonably good workmanship. For those  who are in two minds  please go for this product. There may be other better products (which I have not tried)  but definitely this product is worth the price.One more thing I would like to add here is that we need flat bottom SS utensils for heating on this induction heater.

If you love to watch movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger or James Bond film series  you know how sarcasm and punchlines make the tricky situations also light weight.Here are some good pieces of writing from the book itself:Outside  in the drawing room  the man s body swung lifelessly from a noose of nylon rope  fastened to a ceiling hook. He obviously wasn t watching the programme playing on the sports channel  but the television is on.---Happiness is a journey. Begin that journey today. No advance reservation is required for this journey. Just board the train. Don t put it off  don t delay  don t cancel your ticket!---Æ’??only dishonest cops keep lockers. The honest ones are only familiar with lock-ups.---The book is good in terms of pace and even the characters are build nicely. Twists are coming at regular intervals in the book.

       " 'It is having good menu and off timer but the heat input control is based on automatic repeated on and off duration depending on menu (not on amount heat input). It always input full blast power with different duration and cycles for different menu to meet / compensate near possible suitability. For example if we select Keep Warm  it will be on for 1 sec for every 10 sec approximately  at full blast  due to this  in case of water  it will try to boil with bubbles near bottom of water for that 1 sec for every 10 sec. Further the area of heating is concentrated from inner dia of 100 mm to 140mm approx  hence it is not uniform. Not only that it heats the water in the contents of bowl   NOT the Bowl  which is slow in reduction of non uniform heating. However the plus side is low in heat wastage  means high in efficiency.I have returned it  as it was unable to maintain the water temperature at 60 Deg C in Keep Warm mode as specified   but it was making it to 85-90 Deg C as above ( full blast heating for 1sec etc) .If we select 70 Deg C in Deep fry mode (less than 70 Deg C is not provided)   it was heating to 85 Deg C and restarts heating if it falls below 65 Deg C approx  but with full intensity while heating.I anticipated this and purchased low power 1200w model but the principles and design at least of this model may not be suitable for given menu.Even coil type heaters or gas stove will also face non uniform heating issues   but when we use thick bottom such issues will be minimised as it heats the body of bowl thus conduction takes place which is faster.I feel due to the above limitations it may be acceptable to grevy type items.Updation on 01.02.2020.Infrared type like Wonderchef Easy Cook or Cello blazing 500 or 400 (other models are non infrared or induction type) have better control on temperature and uniform heating but at present they are costly.

And I must say  the book met with each of my expectations.Inspector Saralkar and Motkar are back. This time they are investigating what seems to be an open and shut case of a man murdering his cheating wife and then hanging himself complete with a suicide note with the murder confession. Trust Inspector Saralkar to look closely even in such a case  and what he digs up is a lot of trouble including an unsolved murder.I like this series as it seamlessly combines mystery with drama. There s a lot of drama in the book  whether it be in Saralkar and Motkar s personal life or whether be it in the case. And the comic relief with Saralkar s sarcastic one liners is always a welcome thing in a book. In this instalment  we see the protagonist grow a bit as he ties up all the loops in the mystery. What is interesting is the way the author builds up each sceneÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ from police station to the crime scene  the settings are always detailed. The dialogues in the book are mostly sharp and crisp. By the time the climax comes in  everything is neatly set up for Saralkar to tie up. Not a single plot hole.Overall  this is one of the best IWE mystery books that I have read in recent times. I recommend it to all mystery and whodunnit lovers.',\n",
