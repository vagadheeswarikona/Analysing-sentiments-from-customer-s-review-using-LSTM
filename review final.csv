I can kept my iphone at any place in my home or office, no one can see my messages / whatapp popups etc. Feeling relaxed.3) Good Camera, equivalent to professional Canon/ Sony cameras.

4,This is an easy to read book that is very informative. Mr Keller avoids the extraneous and gives an excellent way to evaluate and use your own perceptions of yourself. If you needed to choose a way to get things done in your life  this is a great way to start. He gets right to the point and there is little doubt of what is important along the way.Motivation is something that everyone is looking for these days and things like attitude and discipline are the heart of motivation. Books like this give people a truthful way to go  there is no free lunch.,books

5,They claim extended cooling technology - but forgot to install an automatic cut-off.Essentially  the device comes with a built-in fan for cooling. I already have PIC 12 model in which  after the heating is done  the fan runs for about a minute or so and automatically switches off.But in PIC 20  it never switches off. They claim it is  extended cooling technology  and we need to wait another 5 to 10 minutes before switching off the device. Are they expecting us to use another TIMER to wait for 5 minutes?This is electronic-age  a simple timer they could have incorporated  if needed with a thermostat so as to turn off the fan at the right time.In short  I returned the item.,home

5,Its been exactly 11 months since I bought this product and has stopped working twice. A much cheaper bajaj   which i had earlier to philips  used to be such a workhorse and yet had very little issues.

5,I ordered this just 15 days back for some emergency use in the house. Due to problem being solved  I did not open it thinking why to check such a renown brand  and coming through such a source (Amazon  as hardly I got any issues with products).. but today when I took it out to use (unwrapped today)  it s not working only. Since the return period is also over  Pigeon customer care is not reachable  I don t know whom to contact or what to repair in this (even after watching multiple YouTube videos). Buying electronics online is always a challenge  thus I m facing another one. Not Ok with the product. I wasn t expecting a damage piece after unboxing no matter what day I do. So I don t even want to give one star  but thia is the least option available. ,home

3,Just the right dosage of why a positive attitude is that important and how to attain it! Simple  straight forward  and well written with very good picks of stories and sayings to illustrate his points! A great read that can be completed within two hours  though it will take much committment to put the teachings into practice and to re-read it regularly to fight against our inertia to change and improve. Highly recommended!Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.Attitudes are a secret power working 24 hours a day  for good or bad. pg 12You must first see clearly a thing in your mind before you can do it. - Alex Morrison pg 27One person with a commitment is worth more than 100 people who have only an interest. - Mary Crowley pg 41 Am I willing to do whatever it takes to achieve this goal?  If your answer is   I ll do just about anything  excpet that I wont do ____   then frankly  you re not committed. pg 44Repeat anything often enough and it will start to become you. - Tom Hopkins pg 55My blindness is a trivial affliction and just barely an inconvenience. - Kent Cullers  Head of NASA s Search for ET Intelligence Project. pg 60Choose words that will point you in the direction of your goals. pg 64If you want to be successful  you must be willing to be uncomfortable  to do things that you are afraid to do. pg 95And the one  YES  (from a publisher) after 33 failures is what launched the spectacular success of Chicken Soup for the Soul. pg 111Success seems to be a largely a number of hanging on after others have let go. - William Feather pg 112If you are positive and enthusiastic  people will want to spend time with you. pg 118I am convinced that life is 10 percent what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. - Charles Swindoll pg 129,books

Just yesterday the technician came and changed the motherboard free of charge under warranty. Hopefully this will not give anymore trouble. I had an old one from prestige which I used for about 15 years on and off and never had issue with that one.,home

5,I received this book months ago but have gotten down to reviewing it only now. Not done  I know ????! But I must say that after a long time have I had the opportunity to read such an absorbing murder mystery. Simply thrilling!Senior Inspector Saralkar is called upon a case where a couple are found dead inside their Pune flat. The husband  hanging down a rope and the wife  lying across a bed with her face brutally disfigured. A suicide note is found that clearly states that the husband killed his wife and then committed suicide as a result of an involvement of the wife in an affair. Although it seems straight forward at first  there are pieces that don t fit together for Saralkar. He  along with his team  get down to solving this perplexed situation at hand  only to find things getting worse as they progress.3 and a Half Murders is by Salil Desai  who has previously authored other mysteries as well. I loved the book! From the start  I was spellbound with the narration. A classic who-dun-it  the story moves in a neck breaking speed  indulging the readers with subtle clues and new snippets of information. The story line is intelligent with punches of emotions and humor from time to time. Straight-to-the point narrative  a clear plot and relatable characters is what makes the book extremely fascinting.The story is based in Pune (happy dance!) and the character of Inspector Saralkar is so aptly portrayed. In fact  it checks all the right boxes for a murder mystery. Uh  did I mention it is one of the most absorbing murder mysteries I have read in a long time?These are the kind of books that make me want to keep going back and drink more of the mystery juice! I am definitely going to look out for other books by the author and review them here  so watch this space for more.I totally recommend 3 and a Half Murders if you are a murder mystery fan  I guarantee you ll love it!,books

4,While there are some really fantastic detective fictions and adventure books already published in India  it is rare to see a police procedural set in Indian environment.  3 And A Half Murders  by author Salil Desai is one such book which is worth reading.The book is written nicely where characters are build gradually and their persona will leave it s impact on you throughout reading and even afterwards. If you love to watch movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger or James Bond film series  you know how sarcasm and punchlines make the tricky situations also light weight.Here are some good pieces of writing from the book itself:Outside  in the drawing room  the man s body swung lifelessly from a noose of nylon rope  fastened to a ceiling hook. He obviously wasn t watching the programme playing on the sports channel  but the television is on.---Happiness is a journey. Begin that journey today. No advance reservation is required for this journey. Just board the train. Don t put it off  don t delay  don t cancel your ticket!---â€¦only dishonest cops keep lockers. The honest ones are only familiar with lock-ups.---The book is good in terms of pace and even the characters are build nicely. Twists are coming at regular intervals in the book. Other good thing about the book is  it have avoided all kind of adult content  which otherwise is seen put by even some famous authors too.If you love crime thrillers and have appetite for police proceudrals  you will surely love to explore it.,books

1,As it is used by babies should not have sharp edges.. but it s not finely shaped and smooth surfaces,toys
1,Not comparable for walking and jogging too tight.size is same as other brand but this item was very tight. Actually I want return back  bottom was damaged.,fashion
5,New review: New model has temperature settings of 500 and then 1000  earlier it was 500  800  1000  1100  1200  which was useful to control the heat better.The buttons are not feather touch. Quality of the wire is also less now. Earlier it was good and strong  now its more thin/easy to bend. They should have more stand height as the fan has very less space to get air. It gets dirty too soon  and chokes.We purchased Pigeon and it was worse.So we purchased Prestige again  it lasted 1.2 years  just about warranty time.Then it stops automatically and repair cost is 800 (nearly half its price) for 6 months.Waste  but no option.Old Review: Our Glass broke and the repair charges is 75-80% of the product.Other than that  compared to Pigeon that we purchased to replace the broken item  Prestige is good.,home
5,Guys Horrible experience in terms of branded electric appliance. How could a brand like Prestige would manufacture such low quality product? I used it only five times in three months and then one day it doesn t work. What the hell! I feel it s better to buy some not so famous brand items rather checking out brands. This product sucks. My money  time everything wasted. Feeling so disappointed right now.,home

4,It worked properly only 25 days. Intermittently it shows E2 error when above 245volts. Sometimes it works  sometimes not as most of time my home has good voltage of 240-260v. So  It can t be relied upon. I Got it for 1100. Don t buy above 1100. Service/warranty is of no use. You will end up spending more than cost on follow up. On site-service should be provided or guarantee(not warranty) from Amazon.,home

5,The product is excellent. Initially  I was in two minds reading some negative comments  but I took a chance as Prestige is a reputed brand. On opening the product  I found it exactly as per the expectations. The heater was nicely packed and delivered on schedule. There were no issues with the packing / wiring of insulation or internal parts  as claimed by some buyers. Those may be isolated cases. The product has many push buttons customised for indian items  like pressure cooker  milk boiling  keeping food warm  deep frying etc. The heater has adjustable temperature/ power for customised heating. The product is light weight and has reasonably good workmanship. For those  who are in two minds  please go for this product. There may be other better products (which I have not tried)  but definitely this product is worth the price.One more thing I would like to add here is that we need flat bottom SS utensils for heating on this induction heater. So if you do not already have them  please do order induction-compatible utensils/cookers.,home

Yes  you can have a good life without a great attitude  but you WILL have a better one if your attitude is better.While it is a little preachy  it does give some great lessons and suggestions about how to change your attitude. To top it off  it also provides some further reading options  and some GREAT quotes!!!!,books

3,If you are looking for some great secret to a better attitude you are NOT going to find it in this book. What you are going to find is a very well laid out plan to do what you need to do (and you already Know you need to do) to make your life better. That starts with improving your attitude.I think most of these types of books say the same thing just in different ways. Jeff Keller does it without coming accross as pompous or or promotional. I don t know if this will be the book that turns on the light bulb for you  but it certainly has helped me.,books

5,I am writing this review after using product for 9 months.... Within 9 months this product stopped to work for more than 7 times and I have to frequently repair it. You will have to throw your half cooked food if you don t have any alternate option to cook food.Pleas ego for other product if you want to cook food Hassel free.Very bad   the worst product I have ever bought,home
2,Value for money,toys
5,I bought this product as it is an upgraded version from the HD 4928 with improved heating mechanism. The best thing about this is it works with literally any type of induction base even if the base is a bit uneven. The prestige induction we had earlier was not able to heat up the induction base which it heated. So thumbs up for that. Also the pressure cooker  water boiling  milk boiling feature is very fast compared to the prestige one I had earlier.Cons is this E7 ERROR.When I purchased for the first time this E7 error popped up after using it for 5 minutes. Then as soon as possible we returned it and the replaced product which we got is working gorgeously touch wood since one month. Maybe the first product which we got was defective or pirated copy version of this. Make sure you buy this product from a good seller.,home
5,I surprised that how the Prestige company (TTK) gone so low in producing average quality products. My earlier product after 10 years of its use is still works perfectly than the product which I buy now from Amazon. Perhaps Amazon is selling low quality products online procured from prestige company. Please stop this type of cheating to Indian Customers.,home

4,I was torn between 3 and 4 stars for this book. I d give it 3.5 if it was an option. Went with four because I think it s a pretty good book that I d recommend reading  but there are several others in this genre that I think are better. Short book  well organized  easy to read. Not really anything that hasn t been said before. Took me a long time to get through as I let it sit while I read other books for long periods of time before I went back and finished it...,books

5,I had phillips and it is difficult to cook chapathi or to deep fry due to its auto cut off. This pigeon is not as quality as phillips  but it does its work perfectly. It gives the sufficient heat for cooking chapathi and for deep fries. If we can cook a chapathi on a induction stove in less than 1 minutes  then that induction stove can cook any thing fast and tasty. I tried many induction stoves. This model is little less in quality and looks wise. But for cooking it does perfect work.,home

5,The PRESTIGE PIC20 INDUCTION COOKTOP has glassy finish ceramic plate. All Indian dish menu option is available in this cooktop. There is no damage while delivery. The package is fully protected with strong cartoon. I bought it in RS1400 which is very profitable with this honoured company. It is better than pigeon induction cooktop. It is also power saving by automatic voltage regulator  cut off after no longer use and consumers only 1200 watt of energy.I advise you all who see my review and think to buy  then I preferred to you all to buy only this prestige PIC 20 induction cooktop. I am rating this product with 5 star because it is best in the market at this price and value for money.Be helpful for review,home

5,It is having good menu and off timer but the heat input control is based on automatic repeated on and off duration depending on menu (not on amount heat input). It always input full blast power with different duration and cycles for different menu to meet / compensate near possible suitability. For example if we select Keep Warm  it will be on for 1 sec for every 10 sec approximately  at full blast  due to this  in case of water  it will try to boil with bubbles near bottom of water for that 1 sec for every 10 sec. Further the area of heating is concentrated from inner dia of 100 mm to 140mm approx  hence it is not uniform. Not only that it heats the water in the contents of bowl   NOT the Bowl  which is slow in reduction of non uniform heating. However the plus side is low in heat wastage  means high in efficiency.I have returned it  as it was unable to maintain the water temperature at 60 Deg C in Keep Warm mode as specified   but it was making it to 85-90 Deg C as above ( full blast heating for 1sec etc) .If we select 70 Deg C in Deep fry mode (less than 70 Deg C is not provided)   it was heating to 85 Deg C and restarts heating if it falls below 65 Deg C approx  but with full intensity while heating.I anticipated this and purchased low power 1200w model but the principles and design at least of this model may not be suitable for given menu.Even coil type heaters or gas stove will also face non uniform heating issues   but when we use thick bottom such issues will be minimised as it heats the body of bowl thus conduction takes place which is faster.I feel due to the above limitations it may be acceptable to grevy type items.Updation on 01.02.2020.Infrared type like Wonderchef Easy Cook or Cello blazing 500 or 400 (other models are non infrared or induction type) have better control on temperature and uniform heating but at present they are costly. However they are also suitable to maintain 55 degree Celsius constantly.,home

4,If you are looking for some great secret to a better attitude you are NOT going to find it in this book. What you are going to find is a very well laid out plan to do what you need to do (and you already Know you need to do) to make your life better. That starts with improving your attitude.I think most of these types of books say the same thing just in different ways. Jeff Keller does it without coming accross as pompous or or promotional. I don t know if this will be the book that turns on the light bulb for you  but it certainly has helped me.,books

4,I quite enjoyed the previous two Inspector Saralkar mysteries. As such when this book released  I bought it promptly with much expectations. And I must say  the book met with each of my expectations.Inspector Saralkar and Motkar are back. This time they are investigating what seems to be an open and shut case of a man murdering his cheating wife and then hanging himself complete with a suicide note with the murder confession. Trust Inspector Saralkar to look closely even in such a case  and what he digs up is a lot of trouble including an unsolved murder.I like this series as it seamlessly combines mystery with drama. There s a lot of drama in the book  whether it be in Saralkar and Motkar s personal life or whether be it in the case. And the comic relief with Saralkar s sarcastic one liners is always a welcome thing in a book. In this instalment  we see the protagonist grow a bit as he ties up all the loops in the mystery. What is interesting is the way the author builds up each sceneâ€¦ from police station to the crime scene  the settings are always detailed. The dialogues in the book are mostly sharp and crisp. By the time the climax comes in  everything is neatly set up for Saralkar to tie up. Not a single plot hole.Overall  this is one of the best IWE mystery books that I have read in recent times. I recommend it to all mystery and whodunnit lovers.,books

5,Have been using this item since many years  induction cooktop from Prestige is most reliable  however always prefer a basic model against higher model with additional feature   simple the model  more the same is reliable. Bought this after as earlier cooktop same model stopped functioning (almost 4 years). After guarantee period  going for repairs is waste of time as such items are not easy to repair  hence suggest to go for basic model. Also induction cook top should be used as stand by option instead of main option for cooking  extensive use will damage the product.,home

The only thing that motivated me to buy the product was the company name  but I think Prestige is also no more a brand you can trust for durability of products.I was disappointed with the price aswell.

5,I quite enjoyed the previous two Inspector Saralkar mysteries. As such when this book released  I bought it promptly with much expectations. And I must say  the book met with each of my expectations.Inspector Saralkar and Motkar are back. This time they are investigating what seems to be an open and shut case of a man murdering his cheating wife and then hanging himself complete with a suicide note with the murder confession. Trust Inspector Saralkar to look closely even in such a case  and what he digs up is a lot of trouble including an unsolved murder.I like this series as it seamlessly combines mystery with drama. There s a lot of drama in the book  whether it be in Saralkar and Motkar s personal life or whether be it in the case. And the comic relief with Saralkar s sarcastic one liners is always a welcome thing in a book. In this instalment  we see the protagonist grow a bit as he ties up all the loops in the mystery. What is interesting is the way the author builds up each sceneƒ?? from police station to the crime scene  the settings are always detailed. The dialogues in the book are mostly sharp and crisp. By the time the climax comes in  everything is neatly set up for Saralkar to tie up. Not a single plot hole.Overall  this is one of the best IWE mystery books that I have read in recent times. I recommend it to all mystery and whodunnit lovers.,books

5,ts a very user-friendly  There is a good Control Panel - Push button for all types of Indian foods. NO EXTRA Training Needed to operate.Durability is looks awesome. This induction comes with 1 Yr. warranty  but I think its a one-time investment. No heating problem and less electricity consumption: Voltage: 230V; Wattage: 1200W.It works only with Induction base cookware - bottom diameter between around 12cm-26cmIts style is good and handy  you can easily carry in traveling also  because of its lite weight.Being a user of this prestige induction. I am suggesting to all of you  You can purchase this induction  without any worry.,home

5,Just go for it. It is an amazing induction which can be used for quick cooking. It has many modes which can be changed according to what you are cooking. The build quality could have been better and the length of the wire is too small. Otherwise it is perfect to use.,home

5,Bought it because of the exceptionally high reviews but it proved to be a dud. From the beginning it was as if you are watch Crime Patrol.The writer tries hard to bring the characters to life but unfortunately fails.

4,It s a great narrative. Being a Bhagat fan   I tend to compare with his previous books. This one is a great plot and very simple to read. But I miss his metaphors and analogies he gave in other novels especially about a guy s feelings. I learnt this about indian men from his books - The species we otherwise assume aren t very expressive about feelings have a lot of them!!! That one part was missing. But a SURE READ. Also missed his highlights of social issues without judgment. But sometimes you can do without them. Great work  Chetan.,books
5,This is just an normal Induction  However spares are very expensive in comparison to other manufacturers.Better to go for Prestige or Bajaj  the life span of the fan or the main board is more or less the same.,home

5,This product is really a farce. I owned an induction cooker that lasted for 5 years before it slowly died on me. This one did that in 3 months. The controls now blink  the power-rating changes (increases and decreases) automatically with a beep  i.e if you set it at 1200 and move away it creeps to 1800 in a few minutes when we move away. The timer-mode stopped working. I regret making this purchase. Heard this company is going IPO soon. With this quality  am sure the shares will sink.,home

There are cracks across the body panel and the cooling fan shuts off on its own resulting in overheating and the induction shutting itself off. And this is after just 1.5 months of use.

It is very easy to use- if you want to boil water you can simply press on the button   keep warm    if you want to fry anything you can press   deep fry  button. You can also control the temperature according to your need! I must say that cooking is made easy for me :),home

It offers various temperature range to chose from when you select curry option which is ideal.In my opinion this offers me a great value for my money.Recommended for every person who is living a bachelors life and has continuous power supply at home.,home

4,Works good without any problem. The Indian menu option selector is not of much help. For example the preset button for idili is 1400 watts which is too high. You just need it around 800 to 1000 watts. It is better not to use these presets and manage with the temperature manually. Also requires an induction based vessel to work on these. Heats up very fast and as of now works very good.,home

3,This is an easy to read book that is very informative. Mr Keller avoids the extraneous and gives an excellent way to evaluate and use your own perceptions of yourself. If you needed to choose a way to get things done in your life  this is a great way to start. He gets right to the point and there is little doubt of what is important along the way.Motivation is something that everyone is looking for these days and things like attitude and discipline are the heart of motivation. Books like this give people a truthful way to go  there is no free lunch.,books

When u put this T Shirt it starts pinching and u feel itching throughout body portion covered by this fabric. One more information; It's small size is 37 and medium size is 39.

5,I received this book months ago but have gotten down to reviewing it only now. Not done  I know ????! But I must say that after a long time have I had the opportunity to read such an absorbing murder mystery. Simply thrilling!Senior Inspector Saralkar is called upon a case where a couple are found dead inside their Pune flat. The husband  hanging down a rope and the wife  lying across a bed with her face brutally disfigured. A suicide note is found that clearly states that the husband killed his wife and then committed suicide as a result of an involvement of the wife in an affair. Although it seems straight forward at first  there are pieces that don t fit together for Saralkar. He  along with his team  get down to solving this perplexed situation at hand  only to find things getting worse as they progress.3 and a Half Murders is by Salil Desai  who has previously authored other mysteries as well. I loved the book! From the start  I was spellbound with the narration. A classic who-dun-it  the story moves in a neck breaking speed  indulging the readers with subtle clues and new snippets of information. The story line is intelligent with punches of emotions and humor from time to time. Straight-to-the point narrative  a clear plot and relatable characters is what makes the book extremely fascinting.The story is based in Pune (happy dance!) and the character of Inspector Saralkar is so aptly portrayed. In fact  it checks all the right boxes for a murder mystery. Uh  did I mention it is one of the most absorbing murder mysteries I have read in a long time?These are the kind of books that make me want to keep going back and drink more of the mystery juice! I am definitely going to look out for other books by the author and review them here  so watch this space for more.I totally recommend 3 and a Half Murders if you are a murder mystery fan  I guarantee you ll love it!,books
5,It stopped working exactly 2 years from the month of purchase. I took this item in November 2015  and now I am looking for a new induction stove in November 2017.

It also offers great advice that s not too deep and helps you change your attitude. I gave one book away and misplaced another during a move  so am buying a 3rd copy to reread. Highly recommend.,books

4,While there are some really fantastic detective fictions and adventure books already published in India  it is rare to see a police procedural set in Indian environment.  3 And A Half Murders  by author Salil Desai is one such book which is worth reading.The book is written nicely where characters are build gradually and their persona will leave it s impact on you throughout reading and even afterwards. If you love to watch movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger or James Bond film series  you know how sarcasm and punchlines make the tricky situations also light weight.Here are some good pieces of writing from the book itself:Outside  in the drawing room  the man s body swung lifelessly from a noose of nylon rope  fastened to a ceiling hook. He obviously wasn t watching the programme playing on the sports channel  but the television is on.---Happiness is a journey. Begin that journey today. No advance reservation is required for this journey. Just board the train. Don t put it off  don t delay  don t cancel your ticket!---â€¦only dishonest cops keep lockers. The honest ones are only familiar with lock-ups.---The book is good in terms of pace and even the characters are build nicely. Twists are coming at regular intervals in the book. Other good thing about the book is  it have avoided all kind of adult content  which otherwise is seen put by even some famous authors too.If you love crime thrillers and have appetite for police proceudrals  you will surely love to explore it.,books

5,This is a very easy-to-read book that packs a powerful punch. Jeff Keller has skipped over the fluff and delivers a very practical and insightful step-by-step recipe for expanding your vision of yourself and your world. If you follow Jeff s recommendations  and take notice of how he has applied these same principles in his own life  there is no limit to what you can accomplish. Thanks to his very persuasive pen  and his good dose of tough love  we all have access to solid principles of personal achievement that WORK! You ll want to grab this book and be sure to cancel all your appointments when it arrives. I ll definitely be recommending this little gem to all my coaching clients.,books

5,I bought this product as it is an upgraded version from the HD 4928 with improved heating mechanism. The best thing about this is it works with literally any type of induction base even if the base is a bit uneven. The prestige induction we had earlier was not able to heat up the induction base which it heated. So thumbs up for that. Also the pressure cooker  water boiling  milk boiling feature is very fast compared to the prestige one I had earlier.Cons is this E7 ERROR.When I purchased for the first time this E7 error popped up after using it for 5 minutes. Then as soon as possible we returned it and the replaced product which we got is working gorgeously touch wood since one month. Maybe the first product which we got was defective or pirated copy version of this. Make sure you buy this product from a good seller.,home

5,The story is written in a nicely manner. Very common to what we have seen in CID or Crime Patrol episode. But the writer has carefully added multiple layers and branches to the story to make it way better than an average story.However  once you have read 50% of it you can easily predict it. The revealation of  Rahul  s dead body was enough to predict what has actually happened. May be I have read enough thrillers so I could predict it.Any way  good composition.,books

4,Just the right dosage of why a positive attitude is that important and how to attain it! Simple  straight forward  and well written with very good picks of stories and sayings to illustrate his points! A great read that can be completed within two hours  though it will take much committment to put the teachings into practice and to re-read it regularly to fight against our inertia to change and improve. Highly recommended!Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.Attitudes are a secret power working 24 hours a day  for good or bad. pg 12You must first see clearly a thing in your mind before you can do it. - Alex Morrison pg 27One person with a commitment is worth more than 100 people who have only an interest. - Mary Crowley pg 41 Am I willing to do whatever it takes to achieve this goal?  If your answer is   I ll do just about anything  excpet that I wont do ____   then frankly  you re not committed. pg 44Repeat anything often enough and it will start to become you. - Tom Hopkins pg 55My blindness is a trivial affliction and just barely an inconvenience. - Kent Cullers  Head of NASA s Search for ET Intelligence Project. pg 60Choose words that will point you in the direction of your goals. pg 64If you want to be successful  you must be willing to be uncomfortable  to do things that you are afraid to do. pg 95And the one  YES  (from a publisher) after 33 failures is what launched the spectacular success of Chicken Soup for the Soul. pg 111Success seems to be a largely a number of hanging on after others have let go. - William Feather pg 112If you are positive and enthusiastic  people will want to spend time with you. pg 118I am convinced that life is 10 percent what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. - Charles Swindoll pg 129,books

5,This is the 2nd time I m purchasing the same model from prestige  which conked off.1st unit worked for more 1year then conked off.(warranty expired)2nd unit purchased in July month and it conked off within a month( under warranty). When you switch on  power trips in the whole house. Initially thought my power plugpoint may be a problem  but it wasn t. I went to switch on using different plug points in the house  power trips every time we switch on.My question is on the quality of product  why is this unit failing so frequently. I even checked my wiring in house to see if power source has problem. But I found all power sources in house are all fine.Pls do publish my feedback to manufacturer so that they work on reliability & quality of products,home
5,It is a nightmare to have this product. Its been only 26 days and it seems like opening a tomb of problems. For first 10 days it worked properly  after that at times it would suddenly switch off in the middle of cooking. I thought that it would be a mild snag. But today it completely stopped working and even the functions key was not responding. As a new customer my experience with this induction is very bad and i would urge people to not to buy this. It seems like the pigeon company products have a life of a real pigeon. I want a refund and would never ever buy any pigeon products. Giving this product a 1 star feels very pathetic but i dont have an option,home

5,I m just ordering this book but I listening to the ebook from my library twice. Some of the stories are a bit lengthy but with the book I will be able to highlight and get the best parts down for rereading. Unfortunate that one of the examples for attitude was Lance Armstrong but who knew. I highly recommend this book and am in awe of Mr. Keller who could have withered and disappeared when his original dream didn t materialize. If you have the opportunity to listen to the ebook I would recommend you do so. Jeff Is an exciting speaker and easy to listen to.,books
5,While there are some really fantastic detective fictions and adventure books already published in India  it is rare to see a police procedural set in Indian environment.  3 And A Half Murders  by author Salil Desai is one such book which is worth reading.The book is written nicely where characters are build gradually and their persona will leave it s impact on you throughout reading and even afterwards. If you love to watch movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger or James Bond film series  you know how sarcasm and punchlines make the tricky situations also light weight.Here are some good pieces of writing from the book itself:Outside  in the drawing room  the man s body swung lifelessly from a noose of nylon rope  fastened to a ceiling hook. He obviously wasn t watching the programme playing on the sports channel  but the television is on.---Happiness is a journey. Begin that journey today. No advance reservation is required for this journey. Just board the train. Don t put it off  don t delay  don t cancel your ticket!---ƒ??only dishonest cops keep lockers. The honest ones are only familiar with lock-ups.---The book is good in terms of pace and even the characters are build nicely. Twists are coming at regular intervals in the book. Other good thing about the book is  it have avoided all kind of adult content  which otherwise is seen put by even some famous authors too.If you love crime thrillers and have appetite for police proceudrals  you will surely love to explore it.,books

5,Tye product is awesome. But  like all other induction cookers  it does not have a knob to quickly turn up and down the power.

This book is absolutely wonderful. It s changed my perception with life  given me the strength and confidence within myself I thought I lost long ago. Thank you so much. My life is improving day by day  as I grow stronger mentally and physically  seeing more success every second with myself and my life. We have had this power inside us all our whole entire lives  even when we think we don t at our worst times and hardest times  we do. The mind and soul is such a powerful thing all around  and can grant us the power to touch the constellations with our own hands if we desired to  the improbable and impossible become probable and possible. All due a change of attitude. -Jacob Lee Stewart,books

4,I quite enjoyed the previous two Inspector Saralkar mysteries. As such when this book released  I bought it promptly with much expectations. And I must say  the book met with each of my expectations.Inspector Saralkar and Motkar are back. This time they are investigating what seems to be an open and shut case of a man murdering his cheating wife and then hanging himself complete with a suicide note with the murder confession. Trust Inspector Saralkar to look closely even in such a case  and what he digs up is a lot of trouble including an unsolved murder.I like this series as it seamlessly combines mystery with drama. There s a lot of drama in the book  whether it be in Saralkar and Motkar s personal life or whether be it in the case. And the comic relief with Saralkar s sarcastic one liners is always a welcome thing in a book. In this instalment  we see the protagonist grow a bit as he ties up all the loops in the mystery. What is interesting is the way the author builds up each sceneâ€¦ from police station to the crime scene  the settings are always detailed. The dialogues in the book are mostly sharp and crisp. By the time the climax comes in  everything is neatly set up for Saralkar to tie up. Not a single plot hole.Overall  this is one of the best IWE mystery books that I have read in recent times. I recommend it to all mystery and whodunnit lovers.,books

5,This book helped me to see more and more that my words are extremely important and along with it my attitude  which by the way is voiced by my words. Many years ago I memorized the following to help me in other areas of my life.  Let the words of my mouth  and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight  O Lord  my strength  and my redeemer.  I never really thought about this referring to actually every word of my mouth -- those I say to myself. But with this book The Lord showed me that I have to say the right things to myself and have the right attitude to excel. Thank you Jeff Keller for writing this book.,books

5,Salil Desai takes the readers on a breathtaking journey of a convict and his 3.5 murders.The narration is fast-paced and engrossing.With simple language  the author keeps the viewers hooked on to the plot.The story does not become predictable at all and   in fact  takes a bizarre turn at the end!But we must of course give some freedom of fiction to the author for coming up with an unique story.The only minor irritant is the love story side angle between Saralkar and his wife which makes your eyes roll out at the very necessity of it in the otherwise superb narration.Nonetheless  another good-to-read book from the author.I would rate this as a must-read for crime fiction lovers.,books
4,Seller priced it more than the MRP and the plastic quality is a bit low. You can go for it.,toys
4,It s a fun game I play with my son. The double sided cards add a new way to play. The dark side has some interesting cards like one that you make people get cards from the pile until they get a specific color  another card you can skip everyone. The dark side layout is beautiful too. The light side is just like regular one.The flip option offers and interesting twist in this classic game.,toys
3,Although very simple and obvious  the principles in this book can and should be leveraged every day to improve ones precious life (and the life of others).,books
5,A fast paced thriller with a good mix of intrigue  emotions  thrill and humor. The description and the surroundings are relatable. Looking forward to more of Inspector Saralkar Mysteries!!,books

But I miss his metaphors and analogies he gave in other novels especially about a guy s feelings. I learnt this about indian men from his books - The species we otherwise assume aren t very expressive about feelings have a lot of them!!! That one part was missing. But a SURE READ. Also missed his highlights of social issues without judgment. But sometimes you can do without them. Great work  Chetan.,books

5,I am using induction stove almost for 10 years. Branded stoves will not last long. Where as I have used one cheap local brand with all Indian food cooking options for 3 years without a single problem.Whereas this stove become dead after 2 months of usage. Warranty service was good. Repaired immediately at my premises itself. Thanks to Prestige  but I don t know how long it works ????According to service person  there was shorting in the circuit board due to cockroaches. Cooling fan openings can t be sealed. However manufacturers should explore some idea of sealing conducting parts either by using some varnish like coating or by introducing insulating barriers between the adjacent current tracks. Or else introduce some sealed compartments for elecronic components  where additional cooling effect is not required. These are only my vague suggestions  but even local stoves also will be having same or similar components arrangements inside the stove. Hence  definitely there will be a provision 5o address this issue.,home

The fan is noisy and doesn t stop even after preset cook time is over.If we want it to stop the fan  while we prepare for some other item to cook  we have to switch off and switch on from plug point only.Single function button to swap between functions  singe plus minus button to reduce heat and minutes  etc Not so easy to use.Purchase prestige or other items than this.,home

5,I quite enjoyed the previous two Inspector Saralkar mysteries. As such when this book released  I bought it promptly with much expectations. And I must say  the book met with each of my expectations.Inspector Saralkar and Motkar are back. This time they are investigating what seems to be an open and shut case of a man murdering his cheating wife and then hanging himself complete with a suicide note with the murder confession. Trust Inspector Saralkar to look closely even in such a case  and what he digs up is a lot of trouble including an unsolved murder.I like this series as it seamlessly combines mystery with drama. There s a lot of drama in the book  whether it be in Saralkar and Motkar s personal life or whether be it in the case. And the comic relief with Saralkar s sarcastic one liners is always a welcome thing in a book. In this instalment  we see the protagonist grow a bit as he ties up all the loops in the mystery. What is interesting is the way the author builds up each sceneƒ?? from police station to the crime scene  the settings are always detailed. The dialogues in the book are mostly sharp and crisp. By the time the climax comes in  everything is neatly set up for Saralkar to tie up. Not a single plot hole.Overall  this is one of the best IWE mystery books that I have read in recent times. I recommend it to all mystery and whodunnit lovers.,books

5,It s deserves 0 stars actually. Read everything carefully before buying.This brand provides cheap quality induction in less costing. Spend 500-600 more and buy Prestige (in image is the Prestige basic model. Has lasted 3 years without Single issue. We have 3 Prestige inductions all in best condition since 3+ years. Plus Prestige has best service)Quality: Cheapest glass top quality in market for Inductions. Breaks easily on long use heating. (Within 15 days broke into 2 parts as shown in photo. Reason - on Tava mode for making rotis). Same thing works excellent in Prestige brand.Electric connection: Even plug is not good. It burnt after 1month. While other induction of Prestige brand had no issues. After few days even wire has some issue. You will just end up using less  and solving more and more issues.Warranty: No warranty for Glass top replacement. It can easily crack if heated for prolonged use. The sevice centre will make excuses saying that this happens in travelling and courier. But that is not the actual reason. The reason is bad quality.You will end up wasting money in travelling to their service centres (which are also very far from prime locations in the city) and getting this rubbish response.Warranty period: Even if you read anything like pay extra for extended warranty or 3-5 years warranty on Amazon site  don t fall for it and buy. It s a lie! The service centre will say warranty doesn t exceed more than 1 year. The end! All your money is wasted!Service charges: They will charge Rs.600-700 for replacing top and for other charges like rs150 for plug replacement. In my case plug also got burnt because of long run use (just 1month)No use of warranty in such cases. Warranty only if product not working when electricity is ON.Make a wise decision and go for better brands even if bit costs more. It will be sitting in your home with 50 issues one after the other.Pegion brand is not bothered of the feedback received from multiple customers with same issue of damages.Don t invite a headache!,home

5,This was first novel I read authored by Salil Desai. Truely speaking I went by reviews only. So hope my review is also helpful.Its starts with two murders straightway. Then comes Saralkar.. Indian Sherlock I would say. Same grumpiness you can correlate immediately. Once you read 30 odd pages I bet you wont put it down.Unexpected but palatable and practical twists and turns with impeccable storytelling.Loved it. Hats off Salil Desai.

3,To me this is a pretty decent book. The title is correct. Attitude is indeed everything. Yes  you can have a good life without a great attitude  but you WILL have a better one if your attitude is better.While it is a little preachy  it does give some great lessons and suggestions about how to change your attitude. To top it off  it also provides some further reading options  and some GREAT quotes!!!!,books
5,The story is written in a nicely manner. Very common to what we have seen in CID or Crime Patrol episode. But the writer has carefully added multiple layers and branches to the story to make it way better than an average story.However  once you have read 50% of it you can easily predict it. The revealation of  Rahul  s dead body was enough to predict what has actually happened. May be I have read enough thrillers so I could predict it.Any way  good composition.,books

I had faith on Prestige brand as i had been using its model PIC 1.0 for the last 7 years with out any problem. this PIC 20 model sleeps on the kitchen surface (on tile or granite) because it sits on plastic legs. The manufacturer have designed the back plate to rest on plastic points instead rubber.thus very disappointing.I have totally lost faith on Prestige and will not recommend any body to purchase this brand.,home
